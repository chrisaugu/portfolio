Dear Julie,

It has been 10 months, 2 weeks and 3 days since the day you left us. 
It has been 10 months, 2 weeks and 5 days since the day I last saw you and talked to you. 

I kills me that I will never going to be able to talk to you ever again and I hate everyone for it. I hate God for not giving you back to us when we begged him. 
I remember the last time I saw you was Sunday. I remember back then when no one would cook and I would be hungry, I would try to cook for myself but couldn't really do much because I didn't know much about cooking so I would call for you to come and helped me. Even if you would watch or even play with your friends and I would disturbed you, you would be mad and shouted "argh!" but you would still come and helped me.

We all missed you. Theresia (turtois), Johanna (Crocodile), and Monica(Monics) they all miss you. 

Tomorrow is going to be your birthday and you know who is always up to date with our birthdays and if he does not remember it now or tomorrow he will still remember it the day after or the day after. That day is going to come and on this day he will just sit somewhere put his head down and just cry
For him, it is tomorrow. He will remembers it he's not going to do anything about it. On that day instead of him being happy he will be sadden by the fact that. That day your day is coming and he remembers it a day earlier than all of us 

We missed you. Everyone missed you. We all missed you.

Your big brother
Christian
